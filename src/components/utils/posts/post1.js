    text: "HEY THERE! Wow, is it June already!? Well even though summer is at its end, it has left behind some great fashion trends that are still alive and kicking! The pom pom is seen on literally every social media platforms these days! Two of the most popular trends are multi colour clothing be it from tops to shoes and the adorable pom pom or tassel trend. <br><br>I have a handful of colorful pom pom styles that I have brought together to make these colourful looks, fusing both these summer trends. It's great for giving any outing or vacation a pop of color and drizzle of fashion. I have put together 3 looks for you guys which I hope inspires you to have your own take on this cute idea!.<br><br><br>"

The T cut, mini pom poms, and colorful stones create a shoe that is every season perfect. So I scooped them up and have no regrets. And did I mention they’re Rs 200? STEAL."

Pretty rare to find them all in one affordable top! I have to admit, I was a tad wary at first of the cold shoulder cut, but when I wore it, it was a surprise how much I loved it! With primary color pom poms, you can’t go wrong for a fun spring brunch or window shopping."
