    text: "HI GUYS!\n AND yes I’m back with the same old denims. It's great to see how we have always kept this trend alive. What truly irks my interest in this piece of fabric, the staunch thick material which can make a simple spaghetti go from basic to uber cool, by just pairing it with a jacket. A lot of people assume and consider the word “denim” synonymous with a pair of jeans or our classic jacket trend. But denim can mean so much more. It can go from shirts to even bikinis. And you can have fun creating your own style and looks with this age old material, by just a few minor variations."

    text: "Speaking about variations, Lately I’ve been seeing that the good old patchwork and embroidery is back again and is a must have in your closet this season. I absolutely love how it brings a new dimension to a look and gives the outfit a playful vibe."

    text: "I’ve seen so many brands like Zara, Only, Forever 21, just to name a few which have come out with beautiful patch work and embroidery designs. But I understand that a lot of you aren’t willing to invest a lot of your money on these brands. Thus, to make it easier for you to welcome this trend to your closet, I have DIY’ed a few looks. They are very simple and a lot more affordable and I’m going to tell you how I put these looks together."

I took this plain white tee with black band on the neck and the sleeves, ironed the patches on them carefully and voila! I was a little unsure before ordering these patches because I wasn’t sure they’d stick to the fabric properly, but I absolutely loved how it turned out and yeah I did a little carried away haha!"
